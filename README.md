## üöÄSignificant enhancements to be made in the core engine


Major drawbacks existing in the Chromium engine and their solution are:

1\.**Privacy Concerns:**

*Chromium based browser face criticism for their data collection practices and perceived lack of privacy*. 

We will optimize privacy settings, including options to disable data collection features. Inform users about privacy-related choices during the initial setup. Consider forking Chromium to create a privacy-focused browser with stricter default privacy settings.

- **History:**¬†Browsing activity done in standard mode to be recorded in reverse chronological order, with the option for user to clear them.
- **Phishing Protection:**¬†The browser should force for HTTPS and should include malicious content blockers by avoiding unnecessary pop-ups.
- **Download Management:**¬†Option to access the downloaded content for offline browsing.

**2.Secure Web Connections:**

Integrate security features, including the management of root certificates. For the CCA India root certificate, we will need to include it in the browser's certificate store.

- **Trust Store:**¬†Service to indicate trust (Preloaded with CCA India Root Certificate) of websites.
- **Web3 support:**¬†Browser enables support for Web3 content.


3\.**High Resource Usage:**

*To tackle high memory and CPU usage in Chromium-based browsers,* we will optimize memory management, introduce tab suspension for inactive tabs (**lazy tab loading**), and provide customizable resource management settings to boost system performance and preserve battery life.

**4.Resource Intensive Updates:**

Chromium updates can be resource-intensive and disrupt user workflows.

We will implement background updates that do not require a browser restart, reducing the impact on users. Allow users to schedule updates to occur during low-activity periods.

- **Browser Extension:**¬†Browser should support enabling/disabling extensions.

**5.Limited Support for Older Hardware/ Compatibility Issue:**

` `As Chromium evolves, it may not perform well on older or low-end hardware.

We will create a lightweight version or mode of the browser optimized for older hardware. Prioritize performance optimizations for resource-constrained devices.

- **Speed and Memory Management:**¬†The browser should use minimal CPU and have minimal possible memory footprint.
- **Seamless Browser Update Mechanisms:**¬†Support Auto-update and prompting for Updates.

**6.Heavy Dependency on Google Services**

*Chromium is developed by Google and has strong ties to Google services, which may not align with the goals of privacy-focused browsers.*

-We will Fork Chromium to create a custom build that reduces dependencies on Google services. Implement alternative sync mechanisms for bookmarks, passwords, and other user data.

- **Multiple Search Engine options:**¬†Support for multiple search engines for user to select from.

6\.**Limited Customization**

Chromium browsers tend to limit the extent to which users can customize the user interface and behavior.

We will provide browser extensions and themes that allow users to customize the browser to their liking. Consider building a user-friendly interface for advanced customization options without overwhelming less tech-savvy users.

- **Customizable Visual Appearance:**¬†Enable users to have their preferences.
- **Bookmark management:**¬†Allows user to add & remove bookmarked websites for frequent access.
